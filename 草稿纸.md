Chunk function signature is also going to change. The output of chunk function will be something like


select chunk("this is an example string ..bla bla bla...", "fixed_width; 11")
[ [offset1, size1, "chunk1"], [offset2, size2, "chunk2"] ...]


select chunk("this is an example string ..bla bla bla...", "content_aware; some_new_argument; some_new_argument")
```

To find good candidate driver transcription factors (TFs) in ageing transcriptomes based on the TRIAGE analysis and the gene ranks you obtained, follow these steps:

1. **Understanding TRIAGE**: TRIAGE (Transcriptional Regulatory Inference Analysis of Gene Expression) is a computational method that identifies genetic regulators of cell identity by combining gene expression data with a gene's tendency to be epigenetically repressed. This is measured via the repressive trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3).

2. **Rank Interpretation**: Since you already have the top 20 ranked genes in old and young mice, you need to use the TRIAGE framework to determine which of these genes are likely to be key regulators or driver TFs.

3. **Calculate Discordance Scores (DS)**:
   - For each gene, calculate the discordance score using the formula:
     \[
     DS_i = \ln (Y_i + 1) \cdot RTS_i
     \]
     where \( Y_i \) is the expression value of gene \( i \) and \( RTS_i \) is the repressive tendency score from TRIAGE.

4. **Prioritizing Genes**:
   - Sort the genes based on their DS values. Higher DS values indicate a greater likelihood of the gene being a key regulatory factor.

5. **Validation**:
   - Validate the top candidates by checking their known roles in ageing or cardiac biology from literature and databases. Look for transcription factors among your ranked genes.

6. **Experimental Validation**:
   - Perform functional assays such as CRISPR knockdown or overexpression studies to confirm the regulatory role of these candidate TFs in cardiac fibroblasts from both old and young mice.

Hereâ€™s a more detailed step-by-step process you can follow:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Extract RTS Values**: Obtain the repressive tendency scores for the top 20 ranked genes in both old and young mice. These scores should be available from your TRIAGE analysis.

2. **Calculate DS for Each Gene**:
   - For each of the top 20 ranked genes, calculate the DS using the formula provided above.

3. **Rank Genes by DS**:
   - Once you have the DS values, rank the genes in descending order of their DS values.

4. **Identify and Prioritize TFs**:
   - Identify which of the high DS genes are transcription factors. You can use databases such as AnimalTFDB or DBD to cross-reference your gene list and identify TFs.
   - Prioritize these TFs as potential drivers in the ageing process.

5. **Literature Search**:
   - Perform a thorough literature review on the prioritized TFs to understand their roles in ageing and cardiac function.
   - Use resources like PubMed, GeneCards, and specialized databases on ageing and cardiovascular diseases.

6. **Experimental Validation**:
   - Validate the top TF candidates using experimental approaches:
     - **CRISPR/Cas9 Knockdown**: Knockdown the TFs in cardiac fibroblasts and observe the effects on gene expression and cellular phenotype.
     - **Overexpression Studies**: Overexpress the TFs in young and old cardiac fibroblasts to see if they can recapitulate aspects of the ageing phenotype.
     - **Reporter Assays**: Use reporter assays to study the activity of downstream target genes regulated by these TFs.

By following these steps, you should be able to identify and validate key driver transcription factors involved in the ageing of cardiac fibroblasts. This integrative approach combining computational predictions with experimental validation will provide robust insights into the regulatory mechanisms of ageing.
