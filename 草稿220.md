Cloud storage tier

Cloud storage (e.g. Amazon S3) is useful, generally pretty cheap 
Downside: internet latency and bandwidth

I want to develop a storage system which migrates “cold” or otherwise lower-priority data out to a cloud service, brings it back live on demand without user interaction

Optional enhancements:
• Intelligent prediction algorithm for migration
• Encryption for cloud-exported data
• Compression for cloud-exported data 
• Can be implemented at block level or file system level
