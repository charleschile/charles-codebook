criteria for success
major risks and unknowns
timeline (2 milestones)




I want to implement a project called "Cloud storage tier". I want to use the knowledge on FUSE that I have learned from class.
I want to develop a storage system by using FUSE python library, which migrates “cold” or otherwise lower-priority data out to a cloud service Amazon S3, brings it back live on demand without user interaction.


Cloud storage Amazon S3 is useful, generally pretty cheap 
Downside: internet latency and bandwidth

Enhancements:
• Intelligent prediction algorithm for migration
• Encryption for cloud-exported data
• Compression for cloud-exported data 

please help me to write a proposal, the proposal should answer the following questions:
What will be built? What is the high-level architecture? The most basic design questions should have been answered by this point (e.g. language, platform, algorithm, etc.).





What are the major risks and unknowns involved?
Do you need extra hardware resources? (Reasonable hardware requests can be granted for projects)
What is the exact timeline for the project?
The schedule must include, in detail, two milestones you plan to demonstrate during project workdays later in the semester (see course calendar for dates).
Be sure to identify the new skills will need to be developed to complete the project, and include the time to learn these skills in the timeline.
If your team server is being used, consider how its use may conflict with course lab assignments -- note this in your timeline.




criteria for success


major risks and unknowns：
1. 预测算法

timeline:
first milestone: 能够实现用LRU的算法将不常用的数据迁移到Amazon S3, implemented at file system level
second milestone: 能实现其他算法如LFU或者根据时间和空间的预测，或者基于时间窗口的预测，实现数据的加密，实现数据的压缩



What will be the criteria for success? Be specific. Include a high-level description of your test plan, including what kinds of testing is needed (unit, integration, performance, etc.)





Criteria for Success

Functional Requirements
- The system must provide seamless integration with the local file system using FUSE.
- It should automatically transfer inactive or infrequently accessed data to Amazon S3.
- The migration process should leverage intelligent prediction models to optimize data movement based on access patterns.
- Cloud-stored data must be securely encrypted and efficiently compressed to enhance security and reduce storage costs.
- The system should allow for real-time retrieval of cloud-stored files with minimal user intervention, ensuring a smooth user experience.


Testing Plan
- Unit Testing:
	- Test individual FUSE operations (e.g., read, write, open, close).
	- Validate encryption and decryption of stored files.
	- Check compression and decompression efficiency.
	- Verify migration decision-making logic using synthetic access patterns.
- Integration Testing:

	- Ensure correct interaction between FUSE, metadata manager, and Amazon S3.
	- Test automated migration and retrieval workflows in a real-world scenario.
	- Validate metadata consistency when files move between local and cloud storage.
- Performance Testing:
	- Measure file retrieval latency under different network conditions.
	- Assess migration efficiency for varying data sizes and frequencies.
	- Benchmark system resource usage (CPU, memory, bandwidth) under different workloads.
- Stress Testing:
	- Simulate large-scale workloads with frequent file accesses and migrations.
	- Verify system behavior under extreme storage usage conditions.
	- Ensure file system stability when handling concurrent access request

Major Risks and Unknowns
- Latency Issues: Cloud retrieval speed may be slower than expected.
- Algorithm Efficiency: Prediction model accuracy needs tuning to optimize migration.
- File System Compatibility: Ensuring smooth operation with various file types and applications.
- Security Concerns: Properly implementing encryption to protect sensitive data.

Project Timeline
Milestone 1:
Make use of FUSE python API and Amazon S3 SDK to set up a basic FUSE file system. Develop the initial file migration logic by implementing LRU-based migration at the file system level. Also, unit and integration tests should be performed.
In summary, achieve automatic migration of infrequently accessed data to Amazon S3 using the LRU algorithm.

Milestone2:
Implement additional migration algorithms such as LFU and time-based predictive models, and develop encryption and compression modules for cloud-stored data. Performance and stress tests should be done in this phase, improve the performance of our codes.
To conclude, Achieve encryption, compression, and implementation of alternative migration algorithms (LFU, time-window-based prediction, etc.).
