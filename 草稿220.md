criteria for success
major risks and unknowns
timeline (2 milestones)




I want to implement a project called "Cloud storage tier". I want to use the knowledge on FUSE that I have learned from class.
I want to develop a storage system by using FUSE python library, which migrates “cold” or otherwise lower-priority data out to a cloud service Amazon S3, brings it back live on demand without user interaction.


Cloud storage Amazon S3 is useful, generally pretty cheap 
Downside: internet latency and bandwidth

Enhancements:
• Intelligent prediction algorithm for migration
• Encryption for cloud-exported data
• Compression for cloud-exported data 

please help me to write a proposal, the proposal should answer the following questions:
What will be built? What is the high-level architecture? The most basic design questions should have been answered by this point (e.g. language, platform, algorithm, etc.).
What will be the criteria for success? Be specific. Include a high-level description of your test plan, including what kinds of testing is needed (unit, integration, performance, etc.)
What are the major risks and unknowns involved?
Do you need extra hardware resources? (Reasonable hardware requests can be granted for projects)
What is the exact timeline for the project?
The schedule must include, in detail, two milestones you plan to demonstrate during project workdays later in the semester (see course calendar for dates).
Be sure to identify the new skills will need to be developed to complete the project, and include the time to learn these skills in the timeline.
If your team server is being used, consider how its use may conflict with course lab assignments -- note this in your timeline.




criteria for success


major risks and unknowns：
1. 预测算法

timeline:
first milestone: 能够实现用LRU的算法将不常用的数据迁移到Amazon S3, implemented at file system level
second milestone: 能实现其他算法如LFU或者根据时间和空间的预测，或者基于时间窗口的预测，实现数据的加密，实现数据的压缩
