thanks for tang han' s introduction to cyber attacks like phishing and ransomware

Now I will introduce some effective protection strategies against these cyber attacks

According to Tang Han' s introduction, we can know that almost all phishing attacks can be broadly divided into two categories
the first one is Tricking users to pass on sensitive information via spoofed sites
and the second one is •Getting the user to install malware through a click in a communication


According to these characteristics of phishing attack, our protection strategy can be organized into two main categories.
The first one is to •Prevent phishing emails from reaching users
the second one is to •Safely handle emails that do reach users

Currently 



> **Anti-Phishing Toolbars and Browser Extensions**: Many internet browsers can be equipped with anti-phishing toolbars or extensions that alert users when they visit a known phishing website.

There are five tips for safely handling emails that do reach users

>Professional copywriters will create emails with well-tested content, subject line,
> It is very likely that any email that contains poor grammar, punctuation or shows an illogical flow of content is likely written by inexperienced scammers and the email is created by the phishing attackers

> _Established brands never ask you sensitive information via email._ Any messages asking to enter or [verify personal details](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/phishing-attack-prevention-how-identify-avoid-phishing-scams) or bank/credit card information should be treated as big red flags.

> Hackers can send messages that cause alarm by telling you things like one of your accounts has been hacked, your account is expiring, and that you may lose some critical benefits immediately, or some other extreme condition that puts you in panic. Such content is typically formatted to create alarm and a sense of urgency with the intent of driving the user to take immediate action.

> In this pattern, hackers send out an email about some pending deadline. For example, a hacker could send out a renewal email about an [expiring insurance policy](http://www.rmmagazine.com/2018/11/08/turning-to-crime-insurance-policies-for-phishing-losses/), or a limited validity discount on some deal that might be of interest to the target. Typically, such emails lead the users to **data harvesting sites** that end up stealing valuable personal or financial information.

> This pattern includes emails claiming that you have won a lottery when you never purchase one, offer of a large cash discount on something that you never purchased, large prize money in a contest that you never enrolled for and so on. The actual intention is usually to direct you to a site where the scammers can get your personal or financial information.



> 1.Email Filters: Implementing advanced email filtering solutions can help detect phishing emails before they reach the inbox. These filters analyze incoming messages for phishing indicators like suspicious sender addresses or malicious links.

> 2.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Even if attackers obtain credentials through phishing, MFA can prevent them from gaining access to accounts. MFA requires users to provide additional verification (e.g., a code sent to a phone) beyond just a username and password.

>3.Regular Software Updates: Keeping software up to date, including email clients, web browsers, and operating systems, helps protect against phishing attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities.
