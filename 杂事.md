I am responsible for the development of client frontend
In the client part,
The client main frame java file is responsible for creating the frame to be shown
And the Text Input Panel java file is used for creating panels with text in them.
The Action Controller is to control the actions of Move, attack, upgrade


If you omit `this.frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);` from your code, the default close operation for the JFrame will be used. The default close operation typically hides the JFrame when the close button (the 'X' button) is clicked, but it doesn't necessarily terminate the application or close any associated resources.

So, if you don't explicitly set `EXIT_ON_CLOSE`, clicking the close button will close the JFrame, but your application will keep running unless you handle the window closing event explicitly and manage the application's termination yourself. If you intend for the application to terminate when the JFrame is closed, it's a good practice to explicitly set `EXIT_ON_CLOSE` to ensure the application exits properly when the JFrame is closed.
