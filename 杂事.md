I am responsible for the development of client frontend. In the client part, the client main frame java file is responsible for creating the frame to be shown. And the Text Input Panel java file is used for creating panels with text in them. The Action Controller is to control the actions of Move, attack, upgrade.


I will talk about my issue first

I think the issue of failing to reconnecting to the server is because when we closed the jframe, the thread of this player was not terminated.
So the player cannot recoonect to the game

If we omit `this.frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);` from our code, the default close operation for the JFrame will be used. The default close operation typically hides the JFrame when the close button (the 'X' button) is clicked, but it doesn't necessarily terminate the application or close any associated resources. So, if we don't explicitly set `EXIT_ON_CLOSE`, clicking the close button will close the JFrame, but the client thread will keep running unless we handle the window closing event explicitly and manage the application's termination ourself.
