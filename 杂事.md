thanks for tang han' s introduction to cyber attacks like phishing and ransomware

Now I will introduce some effective protection strategies against these cyber attacks

According to Tang Han' s introduction, we can know that almost all phishing attacks can be broadly divided into two categories
the first one is Tricking users to pass on sensitive information via spoofed sites
and the second one is •Getting the user to install malware through a click in a communication


According to these characteristics of phishing attack, our protection strategy can be organized into two main categories.
The first one is to •Prevent phishing emails from reaching users
the second one is to •Safely handle emails that do reach users





> **Anti-Phishing Toolbars and Browser Extensions**: Many internet browsers can be equipped with anti-phishing toolbars or extensions that alert users when they visit a known phishing website.

There are five tips for safely handling emails that do reach users

>Professional copywriters will create emails with well-tested content, subject line,
> It is very likely that any email that contains poor grammar, punctuation or shows an illogical flow of content is likely written by inexperienced scammers and the email is created by the phishing attackers

> _Established brands never ask you sensitive information via email._ Any messages asking to enter or [verify personal details](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/phishing-attack-prevention-how-identify-avoid-phishing-scams) or bank/credit card information should be treated as big red flags.

> Hackers can send messages that cause alarm by telling you things like one of your accounts has been hacked, your account is expiring, and that you may lose some critical benefits immediately, or some other extreme condition that puts you in panic. Such content is typically formatted to create alarm and a sense of urgency with the intent of driving the user to take immediate action.

> In this pattern, hackers send out an email about some pending deadline. For example, a hacker could send out a renewal email about an [expiring insurance policy](http://www.rmmagazine.com/2018/11/08/turning-to-crime-insurance-policies-for-phishing-losses/), or a limited validity discount on some deal that might be of interest to the target. Typically, such emails lead the users to **data harvesting sites** that end up stealing valuable personal or financial information.

> This pattern includes emails claiming that you have won a lottery when you never purchase one, offer of a large cash discount on something that you never purchased, large prize money in a contest that you never enrolled for and so on. The actual intention is usually to direct you to a site where the scammers can get your personal or financial information.



> 1.Email Filters: Implementing advanced email filtering solutions can help detect phishing emails before they reach the inbox. These filters analyze incoming messages for phishing indicators like suspicious sender addresses or malicious links.

> 2.Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Even if attackers obtain credentials through phishing, MFA can prevent them from gaining access to accounts. MFA requires users to provide additional verification (e.g., a code sent to a phone) beyond just a username and password.

>3.Regular Software Updates: Keeping software up to date, including email clients, web browsers, and operating systems, helps protect against phishing attacks that exploit software vulnerabilities.


> [Backing up your data](http://www.upguard.com/blog/how-to-back-up-your-data) to an external hard drive or cloud server is one of the easiest risk mitigation practices. In the case of a ransomware attack, the user can wipe the computer clean and reinstall the backup files.

> Always keep your operating system, web browser, antivirus, and any other software you use updated to the latest version available. Malware, viruses, and ransomware are constantly evolving with new variants that can bypass your old security features, so you'll want to make sure everything is patched and up-to-date.

> Comprehensive antivirus and anti-malware software are the most common ways to defend against ransomware. They can scan, detect, and respond to [cyber threats](https://www.upguard.com/blog/cyber-threat). However, you'll also need to configure your firewall since antivirus software only works at the internal level and can only detect the attack once it is already in the system.
> [Firewalls](https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-emerging-threats-what-is-firewall.html) are often the first line of defense against any incoming, external attacks. It can protect against _both_ software and hardware-based attacks. Firewalls are essential for any business or private network because they can filter out and block suspicious data packets from entering the system.

> Whitelisting determines which applications can be downloaded and executed on a network. Any unauthorized program or website that is not whitelisted will be restricted or blocked in the case an employee or user accidentally downloads an infected program or visits a corrupted site. Using whitelisting software like Windows AppLocker, you can also "blacklist" or block specific programs and websites.







Of course, despite all the security measures in place, it's still possible to become a victim of ransomware.
The first 

> **Do NOT pay the ransom** - Security experts and law enforcement agencies strongly advise against paying the ransom because this only encourages attackers to continue their criminal activity. In many cases, there's no guarantee the attacks will provide a working decryption key. Even with a key, the data may become corrupted, resulting in permanent loss.

> **Isolate infected systems** - To prevent a further breach, users should immediately disconnect their device from the network and all wireless connectivity (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth). Although the ransomware may have already affected other users, isolation can limit the scope of infection in the network.


> - **Identify the source** - Figuring out where the malware originated from can help locate the entry point of the ransomware. This information can provide the organization with valuable information to further improve security practices and training.

> - **Report attack to authorities** - Ransomware is a crime that should be reported to authorities for further investigation. However, another benefit is that law enforcement agencies may have access to more advanced recovery tools and software not available to most organizations. In some cases, recovering stolen or compromised data and catching perpetrators is possible.
