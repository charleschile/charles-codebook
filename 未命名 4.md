we, you know the whole idea right? You will be having some documents in S. 3. And then you have to create embedding. And then, yeah, you have to chunk the data, and then you have to create embedding on those channels and then store it in index table. And then like that table would be useful. Very.

create hidden sql table in the back end


So that's that's what I am saying. So right now we don't have the so, for we can allow users to upload the document. But in order for us to specify the document. URL, right?


sql包->sql engine-> logical plan

compile -> physical plan



database -> query plan > logical plan -> physical plan -> execution plan


build.go:
 package which contains all the keywords like insert select Update delete and all those things. So if you look at this, these are actually parser keywords.

`buildCreateIndex`
build index will create index comprises of unique Index Regular Secondary Index vector Index and Master Index logics.

build unique indexes
```go
if uIdx != nil {
		if err := buildUniqueIndexTable(indexInfo, []*tree.UniqueIndex{uIdx}, colMap, oriPriKeyName, ctx); err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		createIndex.TableExist = true
	}
```


build secondary index:
```go
if sIdx != nil {
		if err := buildSecondaryIndexDef(indexInfo, []*tree.Index{sIdx}, colMap, oriPriKeyName, ctx); err != nil {
			return nil, err
		}
		createIndex.TableExist = true
	}
```

secondary index comprises of regular secondary index, vector index, master index

llm也是secondary index
So all the new new indexes also will be part of secondary index, which is the Llm index that you're working on.

 I'm also working on a separate index called the Full Text Index, which I'll be adding to this thing as well.


`buildSecondaryIndexDef`:you have the regular secondary index which you will be building index dev.
And then this is the part where you will be building. Ivf flat index which is the vector, index.


so in the case of Ivf or vector index, we have to create 3 tables 3 hidden tables. Okay? Which will be part of the index. So I am creating details for meta table centroid and entries table.
