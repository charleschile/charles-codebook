thanks for tang han' s introduction to cyber attacks like phishing and ransomware

Now I will introduce some effective protection strategies against these cyber attacks

According to Tang Han' s introduction, we can know that almost all phishing attacks can be broadly divided into two categories
the first one is Tricking users to pass on sensitive information through fake sites
and the second one is •Getting the user to install malware through a click in a communication


According to these characteristics of phishing attack, our protection strategy can be organized into two main categories.
The first one is to •Prevent phishing emails from reaching users

Many anti-phishing softwares can be used for this purpose.
For example, currently, many  browsers can be equipped with anti-phishing toolbars or extensions that can alert users when they visit a phishing website that has marked.


The second category of protection strategies is to safely handle emails that do reach users.

There are five small tips.
As my partner has mentioned, It is very likely that any email that contains poor grammar, punctuation or with illogical flow of content is likely written by inexperienced scammers and the email is created by the phishing attackers.

The second one to be suspected is alarming content full of warnings 

Hackers may send messages that cause alarm by telling you things like one of your accounts has been hacked. Such content is aimed to create alarm and a sense of urgency to drive users to take immediate action.



Urgent deadlines are also dangerous
For example, a hacker may send out an email that gives a discount on some deal that might be of interest to the target. Typically, such emails will lead the users to **data harvesting sites** that end up stealing valuable personal or financial information.


The forth tip is that any messages asking to enter or [verify personal details](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/phishing-attack-prevention-how-identify-avoid-phishing-scams) or credit card information should be treated as phishing attacks.


The last tip is that almost all large financial rewards are phishing attacks.
For example, hackers will send an email claim that you have won a large prize money in a contest that you never enrolled for . The actual intention is usually to direct you to a site where the scammers can get your personal or financial information.


despite these mentioned before, there are also other techniques and tools can protect us against phishing 

The first one is email filters. like The email filters in outlook can analyze  messages for phishing indicators like suspicious sender addresses or malicious links.


The second tool is Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): MFA requires users to provide additional verification (e.g., a code sent to a phone) beyond just a username and password.  So Even if attackers obtain passwords through phishing, MFA can prevent them from gaining access to our accounts. 


Finally we should Keeping our software up to date, including email clients, web browsers, and operating systems, this helps to protect against phishing attacks that make use of software vulnerabilities.



now, Here comes the methods to protect us aginst ransomeware

The first suggestion is to always back up you data to devieces like external hard drive or cloud server. So in the case of ransomware, the user can just ignore the file lock and just wipe the server or computer clean and reinstall the backup files.

Since ransomeware viruses are evolving, it is also important to keep all systems and software updated. 

The third method is to install antivirus software and firewalls. These are the most common ways to defend against ransomware because They can scan, detect, and respond to [cyber threats](https://www.upguard.com/blog/cyber-threat).

The forth suggestion is to not open emails from unknown senders.

The last one is application white listing 
Whitelisting determines which applications can be downloaded and executed on a network or a device. So the unauthorized softwares from attackers will not be allowed to be downloaed and executed on your computer.







Of course, despite all the security measures in place, it's still possible to become a victim of ransomware.
Here are the suggestions for you after a ransomware

The first one is **Do NOT pay the ransom** because this only encourages attackers to continue their criminal activity. 

The second one is **Isolating infected systems** - To prevent a further breach, users should immediately disconnect their device from the Wi-Fi and  Bluetooth to avoid affecting other users


The third one is **Identify the source** - Figuring out where the malware originated from can help locate the entry point of the ransomware. This is a valuable information to prevent being attacked again.

The last one is **Reporting attack to authorities** - Ransomware is a crime that should be reported to authorities for further investigation. 




Finally, to conclude,
my partner had introduced jane's experience of being attaked by a phishing email. This cyber attack can lead to information and financial lose.
And it is also close to us.

The common cyber attacks are consisted of 
•Phshing that make use of emails & fake website creation

•Ransomware that can lock software and files & demand payments




the protection Strategies that we should use are that:

•Always be cautious

•Strong passwords & 2-factor authentication

•Use tools like firewalls and web extensions

•Update system and software
